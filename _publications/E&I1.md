Abstract: COVID-19 asymptomatic cases are hard to identify, impeding transmissibility estimation. The value of COVID-19 transmissibility is worth further elucidation for key assumptions in further modeling studies. Through a population-based surveillance network, we collected data on 1342 confirmed cases with a 90-days follow-up for all asymptomatic cases. An age-stratified compartmental model containing contact information was built to estimate the transmissibility of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. The difference in transmissibility of a symptomatic and asymptomatic case depended on age and was most distinct for the middle-age groups. The asymptomatic cases had a 66.7$\%$ lower transmissibility rate than symptomatic cases, and 74.1$\%$ (95$\%$CI: 65.9$\%$ - 80.7$\%$) of all asymptomatic cases were missed in detection. The average proportion of asymptomatic cases was 28.2$\%$ (95$\%$CI: 23.0$\%$ - 34.6$\%$). Simulation demonstrated that the burden of asymptomatic transmission increased as the epidemic continued and could potentially dominate total transmission. The transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is high and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases play a significant role in outbreaks.

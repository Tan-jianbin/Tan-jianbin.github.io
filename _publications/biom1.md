Abstract: Estimation of age-dependent transmissibility of COVID-19 patients is critical to effective policymaking. Although the transmissibility of symptomatic cases has been widely studied, asymptomatic infection is understudied due to limited data. Using a dataset with reliably distinguished symptomatic and asymptomatic statuses of COVID- 19 cases, we propose a method that considers age-dependent transmissibility in transmission dynamics. Under a fully Bayesian framework, multi-source information is synthesized in our model using a shrinkage procedure among age groups. The added values of accounting for age-dependent transmissibility are further evaluated through simulation studies. In real data analysis, we compare our approach with two basic models and use the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) and its extension for model evaluation. We find that the proposed model is more flexible for our epidemic data. Our results also suggest that the transmissibility of asymptomatic infections is significantly lower (on average, 76.45$\%$ with a credible interval (27.38$\%$, 88.65$\%$)) than that of symptomatic cases. In both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, the transmissibility increase with age. Patients older than 30 years are more likely to develop symptoms with higher transmissibility. We also find that the transmission burden of asymptomatic cases is lower than that of symptomatic cases.

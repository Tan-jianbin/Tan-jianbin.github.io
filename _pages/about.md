Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate working with Prof. Hui Huang in the School of Mathematics, SYSU, since 2019. I'm interested in statistical modeling and inference of trajectory data, such as dynamic data, functional data, or count data from dependent processes in physics, biology, social networks, and so on. I prefer the empirical Bayesian paradigm for encoding the mysteries among trajectories, thereby facilitating scientific discovery and insightful understanding in different fields.

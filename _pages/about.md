Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate of statistics working with Prof. [Hui Huang](https://math.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/485) in the School of Mathematics, SYSU, since 2019. I am generally interested in using mathematical and statistical tools to analyze $\textbf{data with complex structures}$, and I have focused on research about $\textbf{functional data analysis}$ and $\textbf{dynamic data analysis}$, with applications to spatiotemporal and epidemic modeling.
    
During my doctorate career, different projects have been carried out under the guidance of my Ph.D. adviser, Prof. [Yongtao Guan](https://people.miami.edu/profile/yguan@miami.edu) in the School of Business Administration, UMIAMI,  Prof. [Xueqin Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=650) in the School of Management, USTC, and Prof. [Ye shen](https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/ye-shen/) in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics, UGA. I was a [visiting student](https://statlab905.github.io/author/jianbin-tan/) working with Prof. Xueqin Wang in the School of Management, USTC, in 2022.


Research Interests
======
- Functional data analysis: (multivariate) functional time series, graphical models of multivariate functional data.
- Dynamic data analysis: statistical inference of dynamic systems, including estimation of parameters, governing equations, and causal networks of dynamic systems.
- Application: spatiotemporal and epidemic modeling.

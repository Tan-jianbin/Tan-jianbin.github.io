Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate working with Prof. Hui Huang in the School of Mathematics, SYSU, since 2019. Besides, I was a visiting student working with Prof. Xueqin Wang in the School of Management, USTC, from 2021 to 2022.

Research Interests
======
- Statistical inference in differential equations: parameter estimation, non-parametric inference, mechanism-constrained machine learning
- Functional data analysis: functional time series, spatial-indexed functional data, multivariate functional time series
- Bayesian inference: Monte Carlo methods on posterior sampling, variational Bayesian methods, empirical Bayes

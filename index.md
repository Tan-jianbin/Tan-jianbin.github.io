## Welcome to Jia<n style="color: orange;">nbin's homepage!

I am currently a [Postdoctoral Associate](https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/jianbin-tan) in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Duke University, supervised by Prof. [Anru Zhang](https://anruzhang.github.io) and Prof. [Pixu Shi](https://pixushi.github.io). I received my PhD in Statistics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Hui Huang](http://cfas.ruc.edu.cn/kydw/zzyjy/hh/index.htm). During my doctorate career, different projects have been carried out under the guidance of my PhD adviser, Prof. [Yongtao Guan](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/1038),  Prof. [Xueqin Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=650), and Prof. [Ye shen](https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/ye-shen/). I was a [visiting student](https://statlab905.github.io/author/jianbin-tan/) working with Prof. Xueqin Wang in the School of Management, USTC, in 2022.

My research interest lies in statistical modelling and algorithms for data with complex mechanisms, dependencies, heterogeneity, and intricate functional structures. Specifically, I have focused on statistical inference of dynamic, spatiotemporal, and high-dimensional longitudinal/functional data, with applications to ***biological, health, epidemiological, and environmental sciences***. To encode these data features for scientific discovery, it would be beneficial to develop more flexible and data-driven frameworks rather than analyzing data with specific model assumptions. To this end, new theories and algorithms should be established and tailored to these frameworks, ensuring theoretical validity,  computation tractability, and statistical efficiency for the data analysis.

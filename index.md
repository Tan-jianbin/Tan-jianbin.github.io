## Welcome to Jia<n style="color: orange;">nbin's homepage!

I am currently a [Postdoctoral Associate](https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/jianbin-tan) in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Duke University, supervised by Prof. [Anru Zhang](https://anruzhang.github.io) and Prof. [Pixu Shi](https://pixushi.github.io). I received my PhD in Statistics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Hui Huang](https://math.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/485). During my doctorate career, different projects have been carried out under the guidance of my Ph.D. adviser, Prof. [Yongtao Guan](https://people.miami.edu/profile/yguan@miami.edu),  Prof. [Xueqin Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=650), and Prof. [Ye shen](https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/ye-shen/). I was a [visiting student](https://statlab905.github.io/author/jianbin-tan/) working with Prof. Xueqin Wang in the School of Management, USTC, in 2022.

My research interest lies in the topic of statistical modelling and analysis for data with complex dependencies, mechanisms, and intricate structures, particularly including  ***functional, dynamic, tensor, spatiotemporal, longitudinal, and process-valued data***.

## Welcome to Jia<n style="color: orange;">nbin's homepage!

I am currently a [Postdoctoral Associate](https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/jianbin-tan) in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Duke University, supervised by Prof. [Anru Zhang](https://anruzhang.github.io) and Prof. [Pixu Shi](https://pixushi.github.io). I received my PhD in Statistics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Hui Huang](http://cfas.ruc.edu.cn/kydw/zzyjy/hh/index.htm). I was a [visiting student](https://statlab905.github.io/author/jianbin-tan/) working with Prof. [Xueqin Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=650) in the School of Management, USTC, in 2022.

My research interests lie in machine learning, generative modeling, and computational algorithms for analyzing complex data with <span style="color: orange;">dynamic, spatial, or functional structures</span>. Such data often exhibit complicated intrinsic dynamics, multi-way dependencies, heterogeneity, and noisy or irregular sampling, as well as challenges in high- or even infinite-dimensional settings. To address these challenges, I focus on developing new methodologies for  <span style="color: orange;">statistical learning of functions, differential equations, and operators</span>. These methods advance the analysis of dynamic, spatiotemporal, high-dimensional longitudinal/functional time series data, supporting applications in biology, health, epidemiology, and environmental science.

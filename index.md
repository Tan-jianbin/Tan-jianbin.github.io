## Welcome to Jia< style="color: orange;">nbin's homepage!

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in statistics working with Prof. [Hui Huang](https://math.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/485) in the School of Mathematics, SYSU, since 2019. I am generally interested in analyzing **data with complex structures**, and I have focused on research about **functional data analysis** and **dynamic data analysis**.

During my doctorate career, different projects have been carried out under the guidance of my Ph.D. adviser, Prof. [Yongtao Guan](https://people.miami.edu/profile/yguan@miami.edu),  Prof. [Xueqin Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=650), and Prof. [Ye shen](https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/ye-shen/). I was a [visiting student](https://statlab905.github.io/author/jianbin-tan/) working with Prof. Xueqin Wang in the School of Management, USTC, in 2022.

## Research Interests

- **Functional data analysis**: dependent functional data, (multivariate) functional time series, graphical models of functional data.
- **Dynamic data analysis**: stochastic processes models, differential equation models, statistical inference of dynamic systems.

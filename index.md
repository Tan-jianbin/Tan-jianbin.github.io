## Welcome to Jia<n style="color: orange;">nbin's homepage!

I am currently a [Postdoctoral Associate](https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/jianbin-tan) in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Duke University, supervised by Prof. [Anru Zhang](https://anruzhang.github.io) and Prof. [Pixu Shi](https://pixushi.github.io). I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Hui Huang](https://math.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/485). During my doctorate career, different projects have been carried out under the guidance of my Ph.D. adviser, Prof. [Yongtao Guan](https://people.miami.edu/profile/yguan@miami.edu),  Prof. [Xueqin Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=650), and Prof. [Ye shen](https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/ye-shen/). I was a [visiting student](https://statlab905.github.io/author/jianbin-tan/) working with Prof. Xueqin Wang in the School of Management, USTC, in 2022.

My research interest lies in the fascinating realm of statistical modeling and analysis, particularly for ***data with intricate structures***, such as ***functional, tensor, spatiotemporal, longitudinal, and graph structures***. Within these domains, I have dedicated my efforts to exploring and advancing two specific areas: ***functional data analysis*** and ***stochastic process modelling***. 

## Research Interests

- **Functional data analysis**: dependent functional data, (multivariate) functional time series, graphical models of functional data.
- **Stochastic process modelling**: differential equation models, point processes, spatial-temporal processes.
